## Clustering

### **1. Objective**

The primary goal of this phase is to segment 200+ potential donor companies to identify meaningful patterns for outreach prioritization.
By clustering companies with similar characteristics, we aim to:

* Distinguish high-, medium-, and low-potential donor groups.
* Design more targeted email strategies for each segment.
* Lay the foundation for AI-assisted A/B testing in subsequent phases.

---

### **2. Data Summary**

* **Data Source:** “Finance Department Contact Sheet” provided by Second Life e.V.
* **Total Records:** 194 companies
* **Key Features Used for Clustering:**

  * Company type (`for-profit`, `non-profit`, `small grants`)
  * Outreach type (financial, material, grant, sponsorship, etc.)
  * Location (country or region)
  * Contacted status (`is_contacted`)
  * Availability of contact info (`has_contact_info`)
  * English-language support (`is_english`)

---

### **3. Methodology**

1. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Standardized column names, unified formats, filled categorical missing values with `"unknown"`.
   * Converted `first_outreach` to `datetime`.
   * Added boolean flags (`is_contacted`, `has_contact_info`, `is_english`, `is_ideal_candidate`).
   * Removed empty columns (`nan`, `nan.1`).

2. **Feature Encoding & Scaling:**

   * One-hot encoding for categorical fields (`type`, `outreach_type`, `location`).
   * Standardized all numerical/boolean features using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Clustering:**

   * Model: **K-Means** (k=3, random_state=42).
   * Evaluation Metric: **Silhouette Score = 0.304**, indicating fair separation among groups.

### **4. Results & Interpretation**

#### **Cluster Summary**

| Cluster | % Contacted | % With Contact Info | % English | Interpretation                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0**   | 0.0%        | 5.9%                | 0.0%      | Low-potential group — mostly uncontacted, limited info, non-English companies   |
| **1**   | 25.0%       | 95.8%               | 4.2%      | Medium-potential — well-documented for-profit companies, partly engaged         |
| **2**   | 44.7%       | 97.6%               | 2.3%      | High-potential — mostly contacted, structured NGOs or socially engaged entities |

#### **Representative Companies**

| Cluster | Examples                                                                                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | H&M, Kaiser Werft / Boote Pfister, Köhle & Partner Yachtfinanzierung                                  |
| 1       | Airbnb, Allbirds (shoes), Athletic Greens                                                             |
| 2       | Action for Nature Youth Eco-Hero Award, AIMI Kids, Aldi Süd - Regionalgesellschaft Mühldorf/Karlsdorf |

**Key Insights:**

* Cluster 0 contains mainly large commercial or local German firms with limited outreach records — *likely cold leads*.
* Cluster 1 includes high-profile consumer brands with clear communication channels — *potential partners for campaigns*.
* Cluster 2 aligns strongly with NGO or award-based organizations — *strategically aligned with Second Life’s mission*.

---

#### **5. Recommendations**

1. **Prioritize Cluster 2** for early-stage outreach (highest engagement potential).
2. **Design differentiated communication strategies:**

   * Cluster 0 → Awareness emails, short introduction to Second Life’s mission.
   * Cluster 1 → Partnership-driven, impact-oriented messaging.
   * Cluster 2 → Collaboration invitation or social impact co-branding.
3. **Integrate AI Email Generation (Next Phase):**

   * Use GPT API to generate 3–4 email templates per cluster with varied tones (formal, conversational, storytelling).
   * Conduct **A/B tests within clusters** to compare response rates.
4. **Feedback Loop:**

   * Apply topic modeling or sentiment analysis on replies.
   * Refine templates iteratively based on NLP insights.

### **6. Next Steps (Phase 2 Plan)**

| Step | Task                                                      | Tool                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Generate email templates per cluster using OpenAI GPT API | `src/llm_generation/generate_emails.py`  |
| 2    | Conduct A/B testing (controlled within clusters)          | Email automation tools / manual tracking |
| 3    | Analyze responses (topic & sentiment modeling)            | Python NLP pipeline                      |
| 4    | Iterate and refine personalized templates                 | GPT feedback loop                        |

### **7. Deliverables for Next Meeting**

* Updated dataset: `clustered_contacts.csv`
* Email template drafts per cluster (3–4 each)
* Initial A/B testing plan (hypothesis + sample split)
